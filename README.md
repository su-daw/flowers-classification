# flowers Classification

### About:
This project aims at using an Flowers images dataset to predict the class of each flower by using Convlutional Neural Network.
The dataset consists of 5 classes, namely; Daisy, Dandelions, Rose, Sunflowers and Tulips. 

### Achieved Result:
The predicted model achieved an accuracy of 75% with 4 Convlutional layers, leakyReLU as an activation function and Adam as an optimizer.
